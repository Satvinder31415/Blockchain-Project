# Blockchain-Project
Final project for the course "Introduction to Blockchains"

We implement a smart contract which maintains a property database. The
contract shall have a designated authority with the power to add new properties
to the database. Each property has an associated owner, location, and
area. The contract supports the ability to transfer ownership of a property,
as well as the ability to split a property and transfer ownership of the pieces.
Implementing real estate transactions on a block-chain offers several benefits:
transparency, better accessibility, cost saving due to absence of intermediate
parties, and speed.
